# FISH Break-Apart ISCN Annotation Generator
Automating the process of generating a nomenclature from signal count after FISH testing. Users can generate the ISCN nomenclature for FISH Break-Apart probes from signal counts obtained after hybridization of the probes with the slides. Entering the signal counts in the table format enables this app to generate the ISCN nomenclature. The nomenclature is generated based on sets of logic defined by the ISCN organization.

This app alleviates the cumbersome process of manually generating the nomenclature from the signal counts. It also speeds up the process and saves time for attendees while checking a complicated case.
